# Keymap focused on programming

### Should be good enough to work with Windows and linux terminals, VSCode and emacs.

#### Objectives:
1. Easy access to symbols, prioritize `'` and `-`, followed up by `()`, `{}` and `[]`
2. Base layer arrow keys (some travel is fine but since arrows are already used with ctrl or alt putting them on a layer requires excessive chording)
3. Reasonably good access to F row keys, Delete, Insert and finally Home, End, PgUp and PgDn
4. Easier ctrl, shift, alt to prevent problems like 'emacs pinky' or wrist related. Also for enchancing the arrow keys (see 2.)
5. Good control/navigation of a windowed OS and in a browser with tabs: Alt+tab, GUI+tab, GUI+number
6. Provision for ISO letters. Last priority by far.

#### Solutions:
- Home Row Mods: this addresses points 4. and 5.
- SpaceFn: this addresses points 1. and 3. and enables 2.

#### Next Steps:
- Once I get comfortable with Colemak-DHm (https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/) consider moving the home row up to the less used row.
- Identify and add macros or keys to the unused keys
- Remove the bottom left mods (which were added as fallbacks while transitioning to home row mods)

#### Layers
The base layer and the first two layers are all you should need. All the rest are either media related or gaming related or fallbacks.
